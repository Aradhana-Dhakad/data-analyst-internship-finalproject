# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This is a data analysis project where I worked on a telecom customer churn dataset. I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to clean the data, analyze it, and find useful insights about why customers are leaving.

## Dataset Info
- Source: Kaggle
- Rows: 7043
- Columns: 21
- Main column to predict: Churn

## What I Did
- Cleaned the data (handled missing values and removed duplicates)
- Converted some columns into proper formats
- Analyzed the data using graphs and charts
- Found patterns like:
  - Customers with month-to-month contracts leave more
  - High monthly charges lead to more churn
  - Longer tenure means less chance of churn

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run each cell step by step
